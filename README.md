# Linear congruential generator demo

[DEMO](https://krzysztof-grzybek.github.io/linear-congruential-generator-demo/)

This repo purpose is to visualize randomness of PRNG's generated with [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator).

It's possible to setup different parameters for algorithm.

Generated image is 1024x1024 bitmap filled with generated numbers. Each pixel is responsible for each bit.
Each number is 32-bit, so there are 32x1024 numbers visualized.
